## To Do List (PERN)

***This application is still being worked on for deployment.***

What I used:
* PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
* JavaScript
* HTML 5
* Bootstrap
* Webpack
* CORS
* pg (node-postgres)
* RESTful APIs

The To Do List application allows a user to add, edit, and delete to do list items by sending GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE API requests to the server.

The application was modified from the [PERN Stack Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldYcgPKEZC8&t=13s).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
